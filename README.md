# ChebyShev-Approximation-MATLAB
--Credits to Ramesh Kumar Verma @https://www.linkedin.com/in/rms-kmr/<br>
Inspired from the Book Applied Numerical Analysis by Gerald n WHeatley Unit 4 Approximation of Functions<br>
The following is a snippet to a program that evaluates ChebyShev Equivalent for a function defined as e^x or exp(x).<br>
Range for x is set as [-1 : 0.2 : 1] that is x ranges from -1 to +1 with a sequential step of 0.2<br>
The comparison is done between ChebyShev Equivalent as well as Maclaurin equivalent of exp(x) so as to show the error margin betwwen the two and which one gives better results compartively<br>
Since these Programs run on MATLAB, one must have access to MATLAB and move these files into the documents/MATLAB folder in the Users Directory<br>
Main program is V_maths_1.m and rest two are functions for ChebyShev and Maclaurin series for exp(x).<br>
